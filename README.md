# Cornell-Course-Notes
**These are my course notes from all the classes I took during my time at Cornell University. Eventually, all of my notes will be processed from a handwritten format into `LaTeX`.**

---

For now, this repository is rather incomplete, with relatively few courses available out of the many I have taken thus far. I will add more later as I get time. Stay tuned through December 2017! My long-term vision for this is to have an open-source repository that contains all of my course notes off of which anybody can study (and hopefully learn CS completely from the start).

All diagrams, technical and otherwise, were rendered by hand using a section of 92-brightness 8.5"x11" letterpaper and a chiseled thin-tip black marker. Everything else was done using the native `LaTeX` environment provided by any reasonable standard distribution. This allows the original files to be ported very easily to almost any system.

Please feel free to contribute to this by making a pull request and adding your own course notes (for any class, not just CS)! *However, please actively ensure that the professor whose course your notes are based on is completely okay with you publishing a detailed version of his/her/its course content online for non-commercial purposes. Notes that do not have express written permission to be published here WILL be taken down to comply with Cornell's Code of Academic Integrity, unfortunately.* If there is repetition between courses, we can try to merge together the notes the best we can. I will keep a list of current and past contributors on this README.

I request that all notes are completed in `LaTeX` for consistency purposes (and easier management, since all `.tex` files are stored as ASCII plaintext). Please try to use a modular approach as shown in the [CS-3110](https://github.com/chiragbharadwaj/Cornell-Course-Notes/tree/master/CS-3110) folder.
