# Cornell-Course-Notes
---

These are my course notes from all the classes I took during my time at Cornell University. Eventually, all of my notes will be processed from a handwritten format into `LaTeX`.

For now, this repository is rather incomplete, with relatively few courses available out of the many I have taken thus far. I will add more later as I get time. Stay tuned through December 2017! My long-term vision for this is to have an open-source repository that contains all of my course notes off of which anybody can study (and hopefully learn CS/ECE completely from the start).

All diagrams, technical and otherwise, were rendered by hand using a section of 92-brightness 8.5"x11" letterpaper and a chiseled thin-tip black marker. Everything else was done using the native `LaTeX` environment provided by any reasonable standard distribution. This allows the original files to be ported very easily to almost any system.

These are the course notes that I have processed into `LaTeX` so far from a handwritten format:
